This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# Task App Project

## Frontend

- Built with Next.js

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

- `npm run dev` to start

## Backend

- Node.js server in task_management_server
- `node server.js` to run backend

you need 2 terminals in vs code in order to run both so we the project runs
by default you will be in task_app so you can run

- `npm run dev` to start

for backend open new terminal go to cd task_management_server

- `node server.js` to run backend

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
